## Getting Started

To get started with the AI-Powered Travel App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ckaiser258/ai-powered-travel-app.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file. Use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

**Note: The application uses PostgreSQL as the database. Make sure you have downloaded and installed PostgreSQL on your local machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website. Additionally, ensure that the PostgreSQL service is running.**

To simplify the management of PostgreSQL, I recommend using the PostgreSQL App. You can download it from the [PostgreSQL App website](https://postgresapp.com). The PostgreSQL App provides an easy-to-use interface for starting, stopping, and managing your local PostgreSQL instance.

## Features
